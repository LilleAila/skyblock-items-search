# Skyblock item list and search

Built with React, TypeScript and SASS, using Vite

## Contributing

Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/LilleAila/skyblock-items-search.git`, and run `npm ci` (not `npm install`) to install required development packages.\
Change what you want in `src` and `src/components`, and open a pull request on GitHub.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Build the application in production mode into a folder named `dist`. This folder can be served using any HTTP server.

### `npm run dev`

Start dev server.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run preview`

Boots up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at [`http://localhost:4173`](http://localhost:4173) . It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

### `npm run deploy`

Build the application in production mode into the `dist` folder, and pushes it to a branch called `gh-pages`. Github pages will need to be set up with that branch for this to work, and the `homepage` field in `package.json` and the `base` field in vite.config.ts had to be updated.\
Sometimes after cloning the repo, I have to change `base` in `vite.config.ts` to `/` and then back to the repo name `/skyblock-items-search/`. You should only have to do this if you make a fork of the repo, and not if you just contribute to it.

## Background

This project was built using Vite, React, SCSS, CSS Modules, TypeScript and SWC.\
The commands used to create this project are below:
### To create an app with vite, run the following command:

```bash
npm init vite@latest my-react-app --template react-ts
```
Choose `React`, and then choose `TypeScript` or `TypeScript - SWC`.\
This will create a new React app with TypeScript support and you can add SCSS and CSS modules support by installing the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev sass
npm install --save-dev sass-loader
npm install --save-dev css-modules-typescript-loader
```

After installing these dependencies, you can import your SCSS files in your React components like this:

```javascript
import styles from './App.module.scss';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App
```

## TODO:

- [ ] Change to icon-minecraft.module.css for higher quality textures
    - More edge cases like stairs
- [X] Left-align text in search items
- [ ] Enchentment glints
    - [Altpapier/GlintCreator](https://github.com/Altpapier/GlintCreator)
- [ ] More efficient rendering without remaking everything
    - Only what needs to be updated - the ones before the limit (split before not after)
    - Maybe draw in a variable and use `useEffect()` to not have to re-make list if nothing changed
        - (Only a small effect because nothing changes so no redrawing)
- [ ] Use a MOTD parser library to add colors if there are colors in item names
    - [minecraft-motd-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft-motd-parser)
    - [@sfirew/minecraft-motd-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sfirew/minecraft-motd-parser)
    - [mcmotdparser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcmotdparser)
- [ ] Save current search value to url and search for the same item on reload
- [ ] Add links to items to go to another page
    - General info
    - Bazaar prices
    - Auction prices
- [X] Fix spawn egg textures not showing, like "Spawn Jerry" (Villager), "Inflatable Jerry" (Villager), "Island NPC" (Ghast), "Decoy" (Ghast), "Red Claw Egg" (Mooshroom cow), "Super Enchanted Egg" (Ghast), "Move Sam" (Rabbit), "Omega Enchanted Egg" (Endermite)
